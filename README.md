# Motion_Detection_Project

Motion Detection using OpenCV

This project is a Motion Detection System built using Python.
The main goal of this project is to detect movements in a video stream or webcam feed and highlight the regions where motion occurs.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Detects motion in real-time from video/webcam.

Highlights moving objects using contours and bounding boxes.

Uses background subtraction and image processing techniques.

Visualizes the results with plots for better understanding.


ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python

OpenCV (for image processing & motion detection)

NumPy (for efficient numerical computations)

Matplotlib (for visualization and debugging)


This project is an AI/ML based implementation.Â
